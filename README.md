# Movie2Video

This is the source code and a compiled Jar file of my Java program Movie2Video. It's a little Java application for creating video files from DVD dumps or other videos by mplayer / mencoder. Make the Java Jar-File from the source (all *.java files must be a *.class file) or run my own Jar with the follow command -> java -jar Movie2Video.jar!

This is still beta status but the program works well. 
You need in Linux / BSD a working directory ~/Temp/Videos.
On Darwin / MacOS X the directory is also ~/Temp/Videos in your $HOME enviroment.
If you use Windows (8.1) the application wants C:\Temp.

If the program starts you have to answer questions!

Enjoy!

You need a working mplayer / mencoder installation with compilied libdvdcss support!!!
