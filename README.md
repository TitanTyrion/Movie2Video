# Movie2Video

This is the source code and the compiled Jar file of my Java program Movie2Video. It's a little Java application for creating video files from DVD dumps or other videos by mplayer / mencoder. Build the Java Jar-File from the source or run my own with the follow command -> java -jar Movie2Video.jar!

This is still beta status but the program works well. If the program starts you have to answer questions!

Enjoy!
