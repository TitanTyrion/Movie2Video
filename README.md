# Movie2Video

This is the source code of my Java program Movie2Video. It's a little Java application for creating video files from DVD dumps or other videos by mplayer / mencoder. Build a Java Jar-File from the source and run it like 'java -jar Movie2Video.jar'!

This is still beta status but the program works well. If the program starts you have to answer questions!

Enjoy!
